# Security Policy

I take the security of my software seriously. If you find a vulnerability with this GitHub Action, I encourage you to make a vulnerability report. I will address security concerns in an appropriate and timely manner.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Use [private vulnerability reporting][draft-advisory-link] instead.

Please include as much information as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:
* The type of issue (e.g. injection, cross-site scripting).
* The path and commit of the affected source code ("copy permalink" when viewing code in GitHub).
* Preconditions to reproducing the issue (e.g. special logins or environments).
* Step-by-step reproduction instructions.
* Proof-of-concept if possible (be responsible).
* Impact of the issue, including how the security issue might be exploited by a malicious actor.
